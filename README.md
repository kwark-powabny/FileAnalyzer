Program takes a list of text files (".txt") recursively and analyzes:
- how many files there are,
- how many lines each file has,
- how many words each file has,
- how many letters each file has (currently only Latin). 

As a parameter, the program takes the number of threads. When the parameter is missing, the program runs as a single thread. 

TODO:
1. there is still a problem with multithreading
2. currently only counts Latin letters
